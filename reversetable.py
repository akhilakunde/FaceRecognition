num = int(input("enter a no.")) 
count = 10                                                 
while count >= 1:
    X = num*count

                                                    NOTE : 1) giving the input number of a table
                                                            2) defines only 10 coloumns i.e.., count
                                                            3) here num means what we give the value and count means it take upto 1-10
                                                            4) print num means the which we give the value and "x" means multiplies,
                                                            count describes upto 10 times i.e.., (1-10) or in reverse (10-1)
